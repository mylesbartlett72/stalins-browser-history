# Stalin's Browser History
Organisation blocked  you from deleting your Chrome browser history?  Just pull a Stalin and change it to fit your narrative!

## Usage
To remove a page currently loaded:

1)Use the bookmarklet on a currently loaded site to prevent it from appearing in your browser history, by overwriting the entry with your own

2)Double-check this, as depending on the site multiple entries may have been created, and these will not be removed!

To remove a page from older history:

1)Go to your browser history (`about:history` if memory serves)

2)Find the entry you want to \*ahem\* _revise_

3)Click on it to oepn it

4)Continue from step 1 of "To remove a page currently loaded"

(special thanks to Marcus H for discovering that you could remove pages _after_ closing them)

The bookmarklet will prompt you for a URL to go to upon usage.

## Compilation
The bookmarklet can be compiled with [this online compiler](https://www.yourjs.com/bookmarklet/)

Simply paste in the contents of [bookmarklet-source.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylesbartlett72/stalins-browser-history/main/bookmarklet-source.js) and hit â–¶ Convert to Data URL, then wait a while (if you have compiled something previously without closing the tab, wait for the output to change!

Then drag from the blue button to your bookmarklets bar.  You can now click the bookmark that is created to _revise_ your history at will!
